# Reviews Site

## Module 3 Project

### Goals

I decided to review five tents that I either have personally used or have been on the trips that they have been used. I
would still like to add more variables in the review class. I would be able to break down the review a little further
which I would enjoy. I would basically break it down into more categories and get into more specifics. I think if I
would do that then I could clean the CSS/HTML up to make it flow better instead of just typing one big paragraph.
